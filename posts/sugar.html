        <p><span class="person-name person2">Abbess:</span> Hi Student! Good question, my answer is: The first 刹那, the first moment that is no taste, because there is no words, you have to have #6 differentiation, then you can say that is the sweet taste, but the first moment that is 依他起. The first moment 依他起 is just like when you see something - the first moment - you cannot have words to describe anything. </p>
        <p>So the second moment: #6 consciousness will continue to search, what‘s that? and then #6 consciousness has words coming out, and then have thinking, have differentiation, and then for a few seconds, then the #6 consciousness makes a decision, the decision is: Sugar is sweet. I learned from the book or from mum and dad, that sugar is sweet, that’s the sweet taste. </p>
        <p>So the first moment is just like when you see something, that is without words, that is 依他起.  I don’t know if this is clear enough. If not, please let me know.</p>

        <p><span class="person-name person1">Student 1:</span> To fully purify my mind, if I can achieve that, so that I can be of benefit not only to myself but also to the ones around me. That would be a much better way of living.</p>
        <p><span class="person-name person2">Abbess:</span> Okay the reason why we're talking about this is because it's a very rational decision to go after a monastery's life, it’s not something emotional... but it can be also. But to more accurately dig into our own problems, it should be rational. It should make sense, right? So we have to think about: To suffer or not is based on our wisdom. If we have the wisdom to deal with everything, with everyone, we will not suffer. If we suffer, it means we don't have enough wisdom to deal with the things that came up.</p>
        <p>So like 无常观怎么说? Contemplation on impermanence... OK, if you know 所有的缘起法都是无常 all conditioned phenomena is impermanent, yes. If you know that one and you keep contemplating on that, you have the 正念, 一种保持维持的正念, ... If you keep that mindfulness, that’s one way to turn around our defilements. Cause everything is impermanent, there’s nothing to attach to. You attach to this second, next second is gone already. To dig into very little details about the impermanence thinking, those teachings will relieve you right away. You can have the right mindfulness into the non-self. If you can contemplate into the non-self, there is non-self, you can achieve stream-entry 须陀洹. 也就是说,即便是一个无常观都好, 我们的苦就开始减少很多。</p>
        <p><span class="person-name person3">Student 2:</span> Even if it’s only contemplating on impermanence, just this, our suffering will reduce a lot.</p>
        <p><span class="person-name person1">Student 1:</span> I understand...</p>
        <p><span class="person-name person2">Abbess:</span> Because nothing lasts forever, so why would you attach to something that’s not gonna stay there? You are trying to put yourself in a bad place because that thing is going to break down anyway, everything, anything. So what I want to say is we have to make this rational, because by looking, by thinking, by the Buddha’s teaching, we will understand that, even just for one little teaching, if we can contemplate on that, we can cut so many sufferings, we can reduce so many sufferings. If we can make sure on this one, then if you look back, “If I had the wisdom like 10 years ago, I can be so less troublesome in my life experience, I can be more easier [at ease], I can be more happy...” So if this makes sense to you, then you have to expand it. “OK why would I go into the monastery life?” Because precepts protected me, and the Buddha’s teachings protected me, and the meditation protected me, if you have the solid thinking, solid decision on these three, there is no regret, and there will always be brightness in your decision.</p>
        <p>You have to ponder it, “Ok I have to know if this is right decision” Have to ponder it, have to think, have to contemplate “Which way makes me suffer less? Is it the worldly way or the Buddha’s way?” On the precepts side, on the meditation side, on the wisdom side. 戒定慧。就是你要透彻地思维为什么我愿意出家,在家真的是苦吗,出家真的是乐吗?你内心确定地思维过了,你对于这个苦的现前,你自然地你不愿意受苦。没有人要受苦, nobody wants to suffer. If you have the answer so clear, okay it’s going to make me suffer more if I stay like everyone else in the world, I’m not going to do it. I want to suffer less, so we will follow the Buddha’s path.</p>
        <p>所以这就是一个你审思的过程,不是说师父说出家好,或者是经论说出家好,而是我自己说我自己的生活经验, in my own experience, I know if I follow the Buddha’s teachings, if I follow the 5 precepts, if I do the meditation, I do suffer less, way less than I used to, so why not make it like no more suffer [to put a complete end to suffering]? It’s a very easy decision, but you have to go through it. Does that make sense to you?</p>
        <p><span class="person-name person1">Student 1:</span> Yes, it’s very nice, thank you Venerable.</p>
        <p><span class="person-name person1">Student 1:</span> Regarding the teaching on impermanence, is there a specific way for me to contemplate on it?</p>
        <p><span class="person-name person2">Abbess:</span> Okay. You are a software engineer right?</p>
        <p><span class="person-name person3">Student 1&2:</span> Programmer.</p>
        <p><span class="person-name person2">Abbess:</span> Okay. We all know that the display of the computer refreshes like 60 times per second right? Do you take that for granted that yes, it has to be a high refresh rate so it will look more like living stuff? If the screen refreshes too slowly, it will be more like stop motion. It has to look real, like real, moving stuff has to have a high refresh rate right?</p>
        <p>If the real world is a virtual reality game that has such a high refresh rate, are we going to realize it? No. Not going to. But if you think about this - everything that has any movement is changing right? Like I can move my hand around. It’s changing right? If it’s changing, it means it changed its own state already. It’s changed already, it’s not the old one. Everything is changing - 刹那怎么说?</p>
        <p><span class="person-name person3">Student 2:</span> It’s like the moment, the shortest moment possible.</p>
        <p><span class="person-name person2">Abbess:</span> 最小的时间单位,这是最细微的时间单位。梵語 : kṣaṇa</p>
        <p><span class="person-name person1">Student 1:</span> The shortest time unit.</p>
        <p><span class="person-name person2">Abbess:</span> Yes. It’s called ‘kṣaṇa’. If every ‘kṣaṇa’, everything changed, we are not going to realize. Inside our mind, our thoughts, every little thought changes in every little ‘kṣaṇa’. Our environment changes in every little ‘kṣaṇa’ too. So if everything changes, there is nothing you can hold on to. Nothing you can hold on to. So there is no self. Because if the self concept is true, then the self cannot be changed. 这个 ‘我’ 必须要有常住的概念。如果这个 ‘我’ 是不可常住的,它就不是 ‘我’ 了。就是我们很爱,我们对这个 ‘我’ 会有个爱心。如果这个爱的东西,你发现它每一秒都在变的话,你会发现这东西没有办法去爱,因为你不知道它等一下会变成什么。</p>
        <p><span class="person-name person3">Student 2:</span> The concept of a self must be everlasting for us to cling on to it. But if it’s changing moment to moment, we are unable to attach to it because we don’t know how it will eventually become.</p>
        <p><span class="person-name person2">Abbess:</span> Uncertainty is in everything, if you have the wisdom, you truly know everything is uncertain. Every little moment. You won’t attach to anything because it’s all uncertain. Even inside our mind. Our body, our mind and the whole world. It’s uncertain so we are not expecting anything. Everything belongs to conditions. There is nothing we can expect because you don’t know the whole conditions. If you know, then you can see something. But we don’t. If you can contemplate this thoroughly, then you realize “Okay, I shouldn’t be expecting anything because everything is out of my thoughts, out of my expectations, and I’ll be disappointed eventually. So why would I make myself disappointed? No. I’ll just stay on the wisdom that everything is changing constantly, entirely. Nothing’s going to last. From our body, 就是五蕴 - 色受想行识 - 这样观察。观察这个色,这个色法,自己的身体,刹那变异。受想行识是这个心。也是刹那变异。如果身心都刹那变异,这个 ‘我’ 就不可得。然后这个世界也是刹那变异。这个世界也是不可以安住。就是你常说 - 我在这边住,它至少要符合你的期望,或者你想要的那个方向。”</p>
        <p><span class="person-name person3">Student 2:</span> So first you extend on the form, feelings, perception, mental formations and consciousness, and then you see that they are impermanent. After that you extend that to the world, it’s all also impermanent.</p>
        <p><span class="person-name person2">Abbess:</span> So there is nothing to attach to. We can realize to this point because if everything is changing, like there is a random program on your cell phone or on your computer,</p>
        <p>you don’t know what is going to show and you won’t expect anything. And everything is not real. 就是不真实啊,我不知道他们用什么词来讲 ‘真实’,就是真实的法是不可得。</p>
        <p><span class="person-name person3">Student 2:</span> You cannot grasp onto something that is not real, not substantial.</p>
        <p><span class="person-name person1">Student 1:</span> What would the word ‘real’ mean?</p>
        <p><span class="person-name person2">Abbess:</span> ‘Real’ means it’s solid, it’s constant, it’s never-changing. That means ‘real’. 比如说真理,真理一定是不可变。</p>
        <p><span class="person-name person3">Student 2:</span> The truth cannot be changed.</p>
        <p><span class="person-name person2">Abbess:</span> 我们对于一切法的执着,执着它是真实,我一定要认为它不可变。它一定要 constant。如果它是每一个刹那都在变异,就是我现前知道它一直在变,我就不会执着它真实。</p>
        <p><span class="person-name person3">Student 2:</span> If I know clearly that that thing is constantly changing, then I will not think that it’s real. But because I don’t, I look at this thing and see it as being solid, as unchanging and I think that it’s real and grasp onto it.</p>
        <p><span class="person-name person2">Abbess:</span> 我举个例子好了。比方说假设我拿个东西 - 杯子。如果这个杯子,下一秒不见了,然后再过一秒它变成一盆花,然后再过一秒它变成一个汤匙,然后再来它又变成杯子。我就不会认为它真实,因为它一直变。</p>
        <p><span class="person-name person3">Student 2:</span> If he brings a cup and it’s changing like - it disappears, then becomes a flower the next moment and it becomes a cup again, you will not think that this cup is real.</p>
        <p><span class="person-name person2">Abbess:</span> 我们对于 ‘真实的这个执着’ 跟 ‘常’ 是在一起的。真实法一定是常。</p>
        <p><span class="person-name person3">Student 2:</span> We attach to something as real, it’s the same as attaching to it as something permanent.</p>
        <p><span class="person-name person2">Abbess:</span> 所以如果能够观察无常,很多执着就没有了。</p>
        <p><span class="person-name person3">Student 2:</span> So if you contemplate on impermanence, a lot of our attachment will be reduced.</p>
        <p><span class="person-name person2">Abbess:</span> Does that answer your question?</p>
        <p><span class="person-name person1">Student 1:</span> Yes, definitely. So contemplating on impermanence should be my top priority.</p>
        <p><span class="person-name person2">Abbess:</span> Yes, and let me tell you how to do this. Contemplate yourself is like refreshing 100 times per second, real world image. Like the things in the monitor. We all know there used to be those movies that were played by film, if you look in the film, it’s just like stop motion, every frame, right? Or you can edit a video too, they will show you all the frames. It’s actually taking pictures like 24 times per second or 30 times per second. If we are moving, is there something moving? You can always analyze this into pictures. Picture by picture. If you contemplate yourself as always changing material, our body - is a material right? But it’s always changing. If you look at it from a high point, you can always get the picture of it. So our self - our body - is changing, every moment, every little ‘kṣaṇa’. So you can contemplate this, my body is like a high refreshing rate material stuff. It’s not an image, it's material stuff. And then, in your mind too. 你的受想行识。也是每一刹那很快的一直呈现。我都是这么样练习的,就是我这样观察我自己像那个影像一样

        <p><span class="person-name person1">Student:</span> Of course, I have many questions about the theory, there are many questions, many things I do not know. But all these questions I can solve by listening, or by reading, or by thinking. But all these are still explanations right? It’s like now we can talk about the moon, we can study as much as we want, but the moon is still there and we are here. So during the past months, it came to my understanding that something else needs to be done. There is a limitation to what I can understand by just listening, reading or thinking. So one example of the teachings, we say “all things are mind-made” right, and then we have different explanations from different teachers and all, of course there are benefits, there are insights and then one can relate with the world better, but at some point the teachings themselves, they are just saying, at the end, we, the teachings, we are just explanations, we are just names. We cannot bring you further.</p>
    
        <p><span class="person-name person2">Abbess:</span> Yeah. That’s the same question when I had the interview with other students. Because they are also short of the real feeling about all this. For those… have to be moved from learning to contemplating, we say 闻思修.</p>
        <p> So what you just explained - you can hear some meaning, explanation from so many different teachers, that is 闻. When you hear what they are saying and then you have the assurance, then that is wisdom from learning. So that is 闻所成慧, that is wisdom from learning. Have to move to wisdom of contemplating and then there is wisdom from cultivating. So there are three parts. When you move to wisdom from contemplating, that’s the time you have more feeling from inside.</p>
    
        <p>So, the words you understand but you need to… When you meditate and when the mind settles down, then you need to think about - that is vipassana. You have to contemplate, reason and discern, then you will make your own meaning from what you understand. So in the second part, when you are explaining to somebody, you can use the words from the doctrine or you don’t need to use the words from the doctrine, both ways. But the first part, learning is you cannot use the words from yourself, but if you move into the second part, both, both ways. Then when you move to the third part, then that’s the time you don’t need the words from the doctrine and you can elaborate from yourself and it is all in accordance with the doctrine. So if you want to grind the Dhamma flavor out, it has to be from yourself with the second stage and third stage.</p>
    
        <p>That’s the way our teacher, when he was in the Bay area, I think that was in 1996, around that time, then he went to a Buddhist association in San Jose. Outside on the bulletin board there were so many announcements: this person is going to talk about the 阿含经 [Agamas], another one is going to talk about the middle way and another one is going to talk about this and talk about that. So Shifu went there and gave the preaching and then come back and talked to us, the students, saying: all those people, they are highly educated. They can preach Dhamma more than you do (because the nuns they may only have a high school degree), so when the lay persons they are talking about the Dhamma, they can use a lot of eloquent and beautiful wordings, and then is more than you can deliver. So what are the benefits of you becoming nuns or monks? Is you have to learn or contemplate the Dhamma in your meditation. Then, when you deliver the Dhamma, is different from people, they don’t have meditation, they preach and then after you have the meditation, and then you discern, you rejoice and you differentiate and all those, then you deliver the Dhamma is different. So has to be in your meditation, thinking about that.</p>
    
        <p>I think in Venerable Zhixing’s class, I think when a lot of lay people talk about the Dhamma, it is only the first part. Later on, when Sister Student2 is going to talk about something, has to be in her meditation. Then it will make some difference. So don’t worry about that, that needs time. You need time to have the Dhamma taste. If you learn every day, that’s why I encourage you: come first! And then see if you have the Dhamma taste. So you come here, as long as this is a place to learn Dhamma, you learn Dhamma every day, every day, and then it accumulates. More than you can think about it. You just, you know, accumulate it, accumulate it, just like the water dripping, and gradually there will be a hole in the stone. That’s the way we learn Dhamma. So you think you can take this?</p>
        <p><span class="person-name person1">Student:</span> To learn every day? No problem. We’re talking about the first part, of the three?</p>
        <p><span class="person-name person2">Abbess:</span> The first part and the second part, because the first part is learning, and if you want to contemplate, you need to base it on the wisdom of learning. Then you can contemplate. When you contemplate, then gradually, you will have wisdom from contemplating.</p>
    
        <p>So for the third is a must that the mind reaches this degree of quietness. It’s a must, is imperative, has to reach this degree of being very quiet and eventually penetrating on the truth, that is the third.</p>
    
        <p><span class="person-name person1">Student:</span> Can I ask a practical advice to get closer to that?</p>
        <p><span class="person-name person2">Abbess:</span> Is the two merits, wisdom merits, you have to learn, you have to contemplate, and you need cultivating, contemplating, all those, that’s to accumulate the wisdom merits.</p>

        <p>This is the core of consciousness lineage. 名 is you added on. These 5 aggregates, you give the name “Student1”. This 事 (these 5 aggregates) is conditioned arising - alaya, mum and dad, right time… All the things, the 5 aggregates, the 6 consciousness come into contact with the outside world, the perceiver and perceived object are all conditioned arising - this is all 事, all 事 actually doesn’t have the name.</p>
        <p>When this thing arises, one moment, next moment perishing automatically, naturally. Everything arising - they need conditions. but arising one moment, perishing the next moment - this doesn’t need any reason or cause, it automatically perishes. So that is 事. and 名 is added on the 事. Because name has their meaning, 名 has its corresponding meaning and we grasp onto that meaning as real. So this becomes 3 different parts: </p>
        <ol>
            <li>conditioned arising 事 </li>
            <li>and then we add the name on it 名</li>
            <li>and the name has the corresponding meaning 義</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The corresponding meaning is describing the 事 but it’s not 事. For instance, we say fire and we picture the burning thing. But when we say fire and we get the meaning, this meaning doesn’t have real fire in it. So there are 3 parts. 名事互為客. they don’t have true entity, they depend on each other. if doesn’t have 事, then cannot have name. and then you have name, you have the corresponding 事, and you have corresponding meaning. you have meaning because you have a name. so the 3 are relying on each other. Like a guest, come and go, they don’t really own this house.</p>
        <p>Your happy and sad feelings, all those are 事 - they are conditioned. That is the thing you need to examine more thoroughly. All those images coming up - all are conditioned arising, have a name and have the meaning and you are entangled in the meaning - that is the one we need to take it out.</p>
        <p>You need to contemplate it accordingly, and make a lot of examples to assure that you got the right core from it.</p>
        <p>於二亦當推，唯量及唯假。<br>When you say 名 name, that has 2 categories. 名自性、名差別。Student1 is a name, and Student1 only represents these 5 aggregates, it’s different from Student2’s or Zhi Yue’s. This name “Student1” is different from another name “Student2”. You need to think more, 推理 reason it. After you reason it out, you will find out it’s all fake, only your mind contemplating 思量, your observation 觀察. 假 means they don’t have real entity.</p>
        <p>實智觀無義，唯有分別三 when you contemplate the truth, you have non-differentiating wisdom arising. At that time, you’ll find that all the meaning is nonsense. all the 偏計執 is nonsense. 唯有分別三: 名、名自性、名差別. The meaning also has 3：義、義自性、義差別. The 名 and 義 is hard to separate. for example, we say the name “包” have the meaning “I’m full” but it’s not the same as the stomach being really full.</p>
        <p>The name is actually just a name, and doesn't have real meaning. “I’m going to give you a 3 carat diamond ring.” You hear this and you feel so happy, I grasp the meaning so I feel happy. It’s just a name, just an empty name. The name doesn’t have real meaning, we grasp the meaning of the name, then we have happiness, sadness or hatred. The name is just a name, doesn't have anything.</p>
        <p>「實智觀無義」,觀所取的境界是沒有的。「彼無故此無」, 彼所緣境是沒有了, 能分別心也就沒有了。</p>
